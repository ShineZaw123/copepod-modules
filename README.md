# The Copepod Nursery

This is a collection of modules I use in my projects. I'm publishing them here so you can use them in yours if you feel like it.

## Installation

Modules are available on both the [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) and [JSR](https://jsr.io/) registries.

> **Note:** That's not true for all packages, at the moment. Many are still not published. I'm working on it.

To install a module, run:

```sh
# deno
deno add @jcayzac/<module-name>

# pnpm
pnpm add @jcayzac/<module-name>

# bun
bunx add @jcayzac/<module-name>

# npm
npx add @jcayzac/<module-name>

# yarn
yarn jsr add @jcayzac/<module-name>
```

For more information, see the [JSR documentation](https://jsr.io/docs/using-packages).

## Usage

See the `README` file in each of the module, or the docs published on [jsr.io](jsr.io).
